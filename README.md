# EasyPin
Easy to use script to toggle Raspberry Pi pins on and off.

!!!This script is for Python 3!!!

Run command:

sudo python3 /path/to/easypin.py [pin] [state]

Replace [pin] with the pin number of coice according to BCM numbering.

Replace [state] with either "on" or "off" to turn the selected pin on or off.

This script is meant to be used by CodePy developers and beta-testers. We don't reccomend the general public using it because it is poorly tested, horribly documented, and our support team will not help you. Feel free to use it at your own risk!
